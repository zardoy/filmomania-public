I know, design is bad. I'll use [arwes](https://playground.arwes.dev/core) in future releases.

## Build EXE

> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) must be installed.

- Clone this via git / download ZIP
- Install dependencies (just run `yarn` in terminal) and then run `yarn build-app`
- If everything is okay, you will find installer in `build-app` folder

## Features

- It pretty fast and stable
- Greatest UI / UX on the planet
- It firstly used Ace Stream with MPC-HC, then I switched to [Soda Player Plus](https://github.com/zardoy/soda-player-plus) and now it uses [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/).
- And the last... I don't know any alternatives to it

## Roadmap

### Soon

- [ ] investigate other frameworks / solutions: Tauri, [Neutralino](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/#/)
- [ ] Client redesign

### Stale

- [ ] Rename project
- [ ] A lot of integrations!
- [ ] Razer and aura sdk integration (light effects) with player integration
- [ ] Movie scenes parser
